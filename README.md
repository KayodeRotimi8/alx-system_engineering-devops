# **Shell, basics**  
This project taught me about The Shell, Terminal, Commands and types of command, How to navigate the filesystem, . and .. directories, Manipulating Files, How to read Man pages,  Shebang, etc.

#### What is the shell?  
shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.

#### What's a "Terminal?"
It's a program called a **terminal emulator** that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.
